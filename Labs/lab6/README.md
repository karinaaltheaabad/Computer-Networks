# LAB 6: P2P BitTorrent Protocol

In last lab, students learned in detail about P2P networks and how they work. However, in order to work properly, 
P2P networks need to be handled by communication protocols that define what and how data is shared in the network. 
The BitTorrent protocol is commonly used among P2P networks because it provides good general performance. 

## How Does BitTorrent Work?

BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer protocol which means that data in a swarm is shared without the need of a central server 
(in theory). Traditionally, in a P2P network using the bitTorrent protocol, a computer joins the network by uploading 
a torrent file to the swarm.That computer becomes then part of the network (seeder). 
A computer that wants to download the actual file, inspect the torrent file (which contains the ip address of the tracker) 
and connects to the specified file. The tracker, then, sends all the ip addresses of all the computers connected to the 
swarm, allowing them to connect each other. It is important to point out that the tracker never has the actual files 
that are being shared. 

Users downloading from a bitTorrent swarm are usually refered as Lecchers and Peers. Users that remain connected to a 
bitTorrent swarm after the file is downloaded (seeder) contribute to the good performance of the network because 
they contribute to the increase of the downloading rates in the swarm. If a swarm has no seeders, then other users 
wonÂ´t be able to download the complete file from the swarm. That is why seeders are really important in P2P networks 
using the bitTorrent protocol. 

BitTorrent clients reward other clients who upload, preferring to send data to clients who contribute more upload 
bandwidth rather than sending data to clients who upload at a very slow speed. This speeds up download times 
for the swarm as a whole and rewards users who contribute more upload bandwidth.

## Trackers and Tracker-less Networks 

In our definition of how a P2P network using bitTorrent protocol works, we said that it is a decentralized network in 
theory. Usually, that is not enterly true because there are many P2P networks that need a central server to perform 
some specific services in the network (i.e the tracker). One of the challenges in a decentralized BitTorrent network 
is to make it tracker-less. 

In this lab, your work is to explain in a few paragraphs how to make a decentralized bitTorrent network at the high level. 
You are allowed to use diagrams for your response.


### Your response here. 

In order to make a decentralized bitTorrent network, there would be a lot of peer to peer connections in order to work and act as a client and a server at the same time. Each person in a p2p network shares a load of the network. An idea is to store the key and the values in a hashmap in order for communication between peers to happen and scalability will be possible. I'm assuming it's also possible to create a network somehow that would enable the users to be continually active given they allow, in order to lighten the load and improve download speeds.
